Mock Broadcaster (Node.js Version)
==================================

This allows you to send fake STT broadcasts.  Note it sometimes has issues with git bash, so use a different shell if it gives you trouble.

Setup (no TLS)
--------------
1. `cd path/to/mock_broadcast_js`
2. `npm install`
3. `node mock_broadcast.js --no-tls`
